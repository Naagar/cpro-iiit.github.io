      <description>Lab 3 (Week of 4 September)#Question 1#Problem Description#A new student club is organising a huge event this semester for silver jubilee celebrations. Initially, they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough members. So, they started recruiting new members in groups.
Meanwhile, tasks keep coming up within the club. Each club member can work on only one task during the semester.
If there is no member available (isn&amp;rsquo;t occupied with a task) when a task arises, it will remain unattended regardless of whether new individuals are recruited later on.</description>
