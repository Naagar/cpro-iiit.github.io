Explain the types of type casting in C.\nSolution\r#\rThe idea of type-casting is to convert one data type into another.\nThere are two types of type conversions/castings:\n1) Implicit conversions: The idea here is to convert the data type of one variable without altering the actual value of the variable. The datatype can be both promoted and demoted by compiler. There can be various implicit conversions:\na) Arithmetic conversions: Happens when operands in arithmetic or logical expressions don’t have same type. Example: Addition of integer and float.\nint a = 10; float b = 20.0; float c = a + b; // type of (a+b) is float, so it is stored back in `float c` b) Conversion during assignment: Happens when type of expression on the right side of an assignment operator doesn’t match the type of the variable on the left side. Example: assigning an int to char.\nchar pi1 = 3; int pi2 = \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;; int pi3 = 3.14; // Results in loss of information float pi4 = 3; // 3 is an int, but assigned to float c) Others: In function argument; in return statement.\n2. Explicit type-casting: In this case, the datatype conversion is user-defined according to the program’s needs. It can be a lower or higher end data type. Example:\nfloat pi = (float)21/7; Grading Scheme\r#\rDefinition of typecasting (1 mark).\nDefinition of implicit conversion (1 mark) and its example (1 mark). (Sub-types of implicit conversion are not required.) Definition of explicit typecasting (1 mark) and its example (1 mark). Writing extra details relevant to the topic can also result in extra marks. For example: Writing hierarchical order of promotion in arithmetic conversion. Marks have been deducted for conceptual or syntax errors.\nQuestion 3 - 5 marks\r#\rProblem Description\r#\rWrite -35 in 2’s complement form (assume 8-bit representation).\nSolution \u0026amp; Grading Scheme\r#\rThe number 35 in binary is given by: 00100011 (2 marks)\nIn 2 complement it is given by: 11011101.

This means that the code needs to be converted in a form which the machine can understand. The machine only understands Binary code. Thus, there should be a process by which the code we write can be converted to Binary form. This process is known as compilation. You can think of compilation to be similar to translation (For eg: Let’s say you know English but you are with someone who only understands French. This situation would require a translator! This is exactly what a compiler does. It acts as a translator!).\nThere are various stages in which the code is converted from C-language into binary for the computer to understand it:\nPreprocessing: All headers files starting with “#include” are processed in this phase. (Several other forms of processing including the removal of comments also happen at this stage). This generates a .i file Compiling: For now, assume it to be an intermediate process of conversion from .i to .s file. The .s file (known as an assembly file) is a set of commands which our machine knows to execute. Assembly: Code is converted into machine-understandable code by the assembler. The file output is a .o or .obj file. Linking: links library files(eg: stdio.h, math.h etc) to the object file to produce the a.out file, which is a binary executable of the program that was supplied as input. Finally, we execute the a.out file to get the desired output.\nNote: At this stage of the course, it is fine if the process is not entirely clear. It would become more clear in future courses (CSO for CXX students for example). The previous section just acts as a glimpse into compilation as a process being a series of smaller sub-processes.\rReturn values of scanf and printf function\r#\rscanf() and printf() are both part of the standard I/O library in C. They are used for taking input from the user, printing output etc. It\u0026rsquo;s important to notice that these functions have a certain return value.\nscanf() function returns the number of inputs that have been read.\nExample:\nint a; int rval = scanf(\u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, \u0026amp;a); printf(\u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, rval); The above snippet of code would print 1 as its output. This is because it\u0026rsquo;s reading only 1 argument. If the number of arguments increases, then the return value would change similarly.\nSimilarly, printf() function returns the number of characters written.\nint rval = printf(\u0026#34;Hello world!\u0026#34;); printf(\u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, rval); The above snippet would print 12 as its output.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/docs/course_material/practice_problems/week1/","title":"Week - 1","section":"Practice Problems","content":"\rPractice problems for week - 1 (Week of 14 August)\r#\rNone of the following problems require a knowledge of loops, conditional statements etc.\nQuestion 1\r#\rProblem Description\r#\rKeval has forgotten the password to his I-Pad.
