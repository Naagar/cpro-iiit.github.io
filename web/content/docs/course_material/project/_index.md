# Project (Optional)

In the project, you will use all the features of C language and a few more new tools (git, make) to build a game. You will be given some basic code, with tasks for implementing certain functions. The project will help you build your confidence in large-scale programming with 1000+ lines of code. We will provide reference material for learning useful tools like git/make. You must learn some of these yourself (TAs could volunteer to help). 

**Project Repositories:** All documentation regarding the project will be available at the repositories bellow. Students not registered for bonus marks, can clone the repository, try to solve the problem and test it in their local computer. Registered students will have to push their changes to their assigned repos in github.

- [Hello C](https://github.com/cpro-iiit/autograding-example-c)
- [Snake Game Project](https://github.com/cpro-iiit/snake-project-starter/)  

**Grading:** As mentioned the project is optional and you can score 100% marks in this course without doing it. 
The project is mainly to do something fun with programming. We will also provide 5% bonus marks which will be evaluated based on a viva after the endsem. If a student doing the project gets a total of more than 100, we will round it down to 100. We will release the problem statements/code for the project for everyone and you are encoraged to try it out even if you have not opted for bonus marks.

**Honour Code:** The grading is based on viva and if we find that you don't understand your code, then there will be a negative marking!. We will also have intermediate evaluations to test wheather you are regularly solving the problem. Failing intermediate evals, will result in negative marking and loss of eligibility for bonus marks.

**Other Requirements:** You will need to create a GitHub account (https://github.com/). This is only because they provide some tools which allow us to grade and give feedback easily.
