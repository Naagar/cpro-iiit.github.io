# Project (Optional)

In the project, you will use all the features of C language and a few more new tools (git, make) to build a game. You will be given some basic code, with tasks for implementing certain functions. The project will help you build your confidence in large-scale programming with 1000+ lines of code. We will provide reference material for learning useful tools like git/make. You must learn some of these yourself (TAs could volunteer to help). 

**Grading:** As mentioned the project is optional and you can score 100% marks in this course without doing it. 
The project is mainly to do something fun with programming. We will also provide 5% bonus marks which will be evaluated based on a viva after the endsem. If a student doing the project gets a total of more than 100, we will round it down to 100.

**Honour Code:** The grading is based on viva and if we find that you don't understand your code, then there will be a negative marking!.

**Other Requirements:** You will need to create a GitHub account (https://github.com/). This is only because they provide some tools which allow us to grade and give feedback easily.

Interested students, please fill out this form by Friday 9pm: https://forms.office.com/r/y9gEy6jFGK . You may withdraw also before 9pm by mentioning "withdrawn" by editing the name field in the same form.

We hope to release it this weekend and you will need to finish it by Nov 27.

We will also have an intermediate automated evaluation, which if you fail, will result in -5% negative marking.
So only take it up, if you can commit 6-8hrs of work per week.

Yes. But you need to decide by Friday 9pm to be considered for bonus marks.

We are still finalizing. It will also depend on the number of people. so no.
